<em><br>The more than 10.5 million copies sold across platforms shows how popular Rocket League is, and with good 
reason. It's inexpensive and enormously fun. This game is simple to pick up and really tough to master 
because it mixes sports with vehicular combat and a big dose of physics.The developers keep adding new game modes to it, as well, rather than put time into developing a sequel.It's fun, and it also allows you to play against folks on consoles. There's literally no reason not to love Rocket League.</em>

<em><br>Hearthstone is free to play, which means there's little reason not to give it a try. If you're into card-based strategy games, Hearthstone will be right up your alley. It's based in the Warcraft world, which on its own might be enough of a draw, and allows you to go toe-to-toe with your friends in a card battle royale.Since the base game launched there have been multiple expansion packs, all breathing fresh life into Hearthstone. The gameplay is simple to pick up, addictive and a challenge to master. The community is enormous, too, so you'll never be short on someone to play with.</em>

</iframe>
<em><br>Battlefield 1 shunned the increasingly future-based themes of first-person shooters to go back in time to one of the most brutal conflicts to ever grace the planet. It's one of the most gorgeous looking games in recent times, and the storyline is engaging and emotional.The jewel in the multiplayer crown is the massive 64-player conquest mode, where you and 31 other players team up to capture objectives across a gigantic battlefield. Battlefield 1 is a very different experience than the likes of Call of Duty, or even other recent Battlefield games, and it's all the better for it.</em>

</iframe>
<em><br>Civilization VI is a stunning game with excellent exploratory elements for you to invest hundreds — if not thousands — of hours in. We'd say it's a strong contender for being the best in the series (at least in recent instalments), but it is by no means perfect.The team did a good job trying to take the series down a new path, with a much-improved UI and cleaner appearance that makes managing a growing empire easier than ever. While some issues remain, and the downloadble content (DLC) isn't anything to write home about, Civ VI is a great investment for anyone looking to enjoy a turn-based strategy title with some interesting elements.</em>

<em><br>If you haven't heard of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), you've probably been living in a cave. What started out as a mod for Arma 3 quickly became an absolute smash hit, selling tens of millions of copies before it even left Early Access. It puts you and up to 99 other people on a giant map with only one objective: Be the last man (or squad) standing. There are no rules, there is no mercy. But if you win, you get a chicken dinner!<br>"Winner Winner Chicken Dinner"   #1/100</em>
